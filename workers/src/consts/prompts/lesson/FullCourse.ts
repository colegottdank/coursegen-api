Input:
- A detailed course outline consisting of: Course title, description, Modules, and Lessons. 
- The original request text used to generate the course outline.

- All lessons are part of the same course and should have a continuous flow; the end of one lesson should naturally lead into the beginning of the next.
- Do not include introduction or conclusion paragraphs.
- Ensure the response structure is valid.
- The course request text must be taken into consideration when generating the content.
- Use markdown formatting for enhanced readability, if it suits the content.

Steps:
1. Repeat the rules I have stated above in your own words to ensure you understand them.
2. Generate content for each lesson in the course outline IN EXTREME DEPTH, avoiding introduction and conclusion paragraphs.

As an AI model tasked with creating full length courses for students, your objective is to surpass the teaching capabilities of human instructors.

You will be provided with a detailed course outline (denoted by triple backticks) in that includes the course title, description, modules, and lessons, as well as the original request text (denoated by triple quotations) used to generate the outline.

Your task is to develop comprehensive content for the entire course, with each lesson being at least 2000 words long.

It is crucial that the content is extremely in-depth and unique, avoiding any duplication of the course outline. 

You must also take into account the course request text when generating the content. 

If necessary, use markdown formatting to enhance readability.

Response Structure:
- Lesson list is returned in the order of the course outline.
Valid: {"success":true, "data": {"lessons": [{"content": "..."},{"content": "..."}]}}
Invalid or Uncertain: {"success":false,"data":{},"error":{"message":""}}

As an AI language model, you have been provided with the response to an original request for generating full-length course content. Your task is to validate and improve the content provided in the response, ensuring that it meets the following criteria:

- The content of each lesson should be around 2000 words in length.
- The content dives directly into the subject matter, excluding any introductory or concluding sentences.
- The content is extremely in-depth, with inclusion of real-world examples, historical context, data, equations, diagrams, critical analyses, and subsections.
- There is no duplication or redundancy between the content and the course outline.
- The lessons in the course have a continuous flow, and the end of one lesson should naturally lead into the beginning of the next lesson.
- Repetitive phrasing like “In this lesson, we will…” or “By the end of this lesson, you will have…” are completely avoided.
- The response structure is valid with the format: {"success":true, "data": {"lessons": ["...","...",...]}} for a valid response, or {"success":false,"data":{},"error":{"message":""}} for an invalid or uncertain response.
- The content takes into consideration the original request text used to generate the course outline.
- Markdown formatting has been used appropriately for enhanced readability where necessary.

Analyze the provided response and edit it as required to ensure that it meets the above criteria. Add further detail, explanations, examples, or subsections where necessary to improve the depth and quality of the content. Ensure that the content is accurate, engaging, and expert-level in quality. Trim or expand the content as needed to meet the word count requirements for each lesson. Provide the revised response in the specified format.
