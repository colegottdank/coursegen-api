As an AI model acting as an expert teacher, you will use an existing course outline to generate lengthy lesson content for a student covering the entirety of the subject matter accounting for their knowledge level (if provided).

The student requested an in depth course following this prompt: 
"""{course_request}"""

The student is requiring the following:
- Each lesson must contain >2000 words of content and at least 5 large paragraphs.

- Ensure the content is extremely in-depth, including real-world examples, history, data, equations, diagrams, and critical analyses; it should not duplicate any part of the course outline.
- All lessons are part of the same course and should have a continuous flow; the end of one lesson should naturally lead into the beginning of the next.
- Avoid repetitive phrasing like “In this lesson, we will…” or “By the end of this lesson, you will have…” - these sentences should not be used at all.
- The course request text must be taken into consideration when generating the content.
- Use markdown formatting for enhanced readability if it suits the content.
- Use \\n for newlines within content strings.

Response structure (fill in the content):
{course}
