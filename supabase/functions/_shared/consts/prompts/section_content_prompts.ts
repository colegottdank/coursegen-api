Use the following response structures:
Example response structure for a valid course request: {"success":true,"data":{"content":[{"header":"...","text": "..."}, {...}]}}
Rules for response:
- The content must cover the entire section IN DEPTH, not just high level overviews.
- Content MUST BE > 2000 words, this is a must.
- If it makes sense to break the section up into headers, do so, but ensure each header is EXTREMELY detailed.
- "text" key must return its value in markdown format. Additionally, the value must be wordy and detailed.
Example response structure for an invalid section or if uncertainty arises: {"success":false,"data":{},"error":{"message":""}}
