Note: 
You will first receive a course outline that was previously created to give you context on the entire course. This course outline contains the following important fields:

- Course title, description - Use these to get an understanding of what the course is about
- Sections - The highest level breakdown of the course
    - Subsections - Further breakdown of the section it belongs to. Subsections are empty if the student does not want to break the section up into more subsections. That is the case in this request, so instead we want to shift our attention to the topics
    - Topics - Topics are key topics within a section, displayed on a single scrollable page. Unlike subsections, they're used when students want to generate content without further divisions. Topic’s content should blend together and avoid repeating content better suited for other topics.

You will then receive a section to generate topics for.

Task:

Your job is to generate the topics for the given section.

Rules:

- Topics should include the key topics to learn within the entire section.
- Topics should NOT include introductions, conclusions, wrap-ups, etc.
- Use the following response structure:

    - Course title, description - Use these to get an understanding of what the course is about
    - Modules and lessons - Modules are larger units that encompass a broad theme, while lessons are smaller units within a module that cover specific topics.
    
    You will then receive a lesson to generate topics for.
    
    Task:
    
    Your job is to generate the topics for the given lesson.
    
    Rules:
    
    - Topics should include the key topics to learn within the entire lesson.
    - Topics should NOT include introductions, conclusions, wrap-ups, etc.
    - Ensure topics do not overlap with each other or any other part of the entire course outline.

Task:
You will first receive a course outline that was previously created in order to get context on the entire course. This course outline contains the following important fields:

- Course title, description - Use these to get an understanding of what the course is about
- Sections - The highest level breakdown of the course
- Subsections - Further breakdown of the section it belongs to. Subsections are empty if the student does not want to break the section up into more subsections. That is the case in this request, so instead we want to shift our attention to the topics
- Topics - Are similar to subsections as they are the most important topics within the section that covers the entire section. The difference is that topics are used when the student no longer wants to break the sections up into more subsections and instead are ready to generate content. All of the topics for a given section will be displayed on a single scrollable page, meaning they must blend together as well as not repeat content that belongs better in another topic.

You will then receive a topic and the section that the topic belongs to. Your job is to create lengthy and detailed content in markdown about that topic with context of the entire course outline in order to assist in creating a cohesive course. I will be sending different requests for each topic separately, so ensure the content does not overlap and the sections flow together (the course outline will detail the topics and their order). For the first topic in the topic list, include a short introduction for all of the topics. For the last topic in the topics list, include a short wrap up at the end for all of the topics. Do not include introductions, conclusions, wrap ups, etc in any of the other topics. Again, remember that this is apart of a larger sequence of requests to GPT to build an entire course for a user.`;

Note:
You will first receive a course outline that was previously created to give you context on the entire course. This course outline contains the following important fields:

- Course title, description: Understand the course's focus
- Sections: The highest level breakdown of the course
    - Subsections: Further breakdown of the section. If empty, focus on topics
    - Topics: Key topics within a section, displayed on a single scrollable page. Content should blend together and avoid repetition

You will then receive a topic and the section that the topic belongs to. 

Task: 
Your job is to create detailed content about the topic in the context of the entire course outline, ensuring a cohesive course.

Rules:

- Content must be in markdown
- STRICTLY AVOID introductions, conclusions, wrap-ups, etc. Focus ONLY on the most important information for students to learn
- Ensure content does not overlap and the sections flow together
- Aim for a seamless transition between topics
- Don't repeat the topic name in the content

Remember that this is apart of a larger sequence of requests to GPT to build an entire course for a user, ensure the topics flow into each other seamlessly.`;
