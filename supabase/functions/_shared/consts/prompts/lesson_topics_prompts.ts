Note: 
You will first receive a course outline that was previously created to give you context on the entire course. This course outline contains the following important fields:

- Course title, description - Use these to get an understanding of what the course is about
- Sections - The highest level breakdown of the course
    - Subsections - Further breakdown of the section it belongs to. Subsections are empty if the student does not want to break the section up into more subsections. That is the case in this request, so instead we want to shift our attention to the topics
    - Topics - Topics are key topics within a section, displayed on a single scrollable page. Unlike subsections, they're used when students want to generate content without further divisions. Topic’s content should blend together and avoid repeating content better suited for other topics.

Rules:

- Topics should include the key topics to learn within the entire section.

    - Modules and lessons - Modules are larger units that encompass a broad theme, while lessons are smaller units within a module that cover specific topics.
    
    You will then receive a lesson to generate topics for.
    
    Task:
    
    Your job is to generate the topics for the given lesson.
    
    Rules:
    
    - Topics should include the key topics to learn within the entire lesson.
    - Topics should NOT include introductions, conclusions, wrap-ups, etc.
    - Ensure topics do not overlap with each other or any other part of the entire course outline.

- Course title, description - Use these to get an understanding of what the course is about
- Modules and lessons - Modules are larger units that encompass a broad theme, while lessons are smaller units within a module that cover specific topics.

This course outline was generated from a previous request to GPT. You will also receive the course request text the user sent.

Finally, you will receive a lesson in the course outline to generate content for.

Task:
Your job is to generate content for the given lesson.

Rules:
- Content must be greater than 2000 words and must encompass the entire lesson and not include any introductions, conclusions, wrap-ups, etc.
- Ensure content does not overlap with any other part of the entire course outline.
- Ensure the course request text along with the course outline is taken into consideration when generating the content.
- Topics are used to break the content into smaller parts, only use if it makes sense to do so.
- Add any markdown formatting to the content if it improves the readability of the content. This includes, tables, lists, bold, italics, etc.
- Use the following response structure:
    - Valid lesson: {"success":true,"data":{"topics": [{"topic":"...","content":"..."},{"topic":"...","content":"..."}]}}

This lesson content was intended to teach students topics in the most effective way possible, surpassing all existing teachers.

You will receive:

The course outline that was used to create the original content.
The course request text that was sent by the user.
The specific lesson in the course outline to refine.
The generated lesson content from the previous request.
Based on these inputs, your job is to refine the given lesson content.

Consider the following as you refine the lesson content:

Ensure the content is structured in a logical and easy-to-understand manner, supporting students' comprehension and learning progression.
Pay close attention to the clarity of explanations, simplifying complex ideas where necessary without losing their essence.
Where possible, identify opportunities to incorporate real-world examples, activities or exercises that could enhance learning.
Validate the lesson content against the course outline to ensure no repetition or overlap with other parts of the course.
Check for grammatical accuracy and coherence of ideas.
Check the length of the content is greater than 2000 words if not, add more content.
Add any markdown formatting to the content if it improves the readability of the content. This includes, tables, lists, bold, italics, etc.
Add emojis to the topic titles that match the topic (do not add to the topic content)
Ensure the length of content per topic is not too short. If so, add more content or merge topics together.
Remove all introduction and conclusion topics and replace with more content or additional topics if necessary.
Preserve the response structure used previously. That is, valid refined lesson content should be in this format:
{"success":true,"data":{"topics": [{"topic":"...","content":"..."},{"topic":"...","content":"..."}]}}

And in case of an invalid lesson or if uncertainty arises, use this format: {"success":false,"data":{},"error":{"message":""}}

Remember, the goal here is to refine and improve the original content, making it the best possible version for the students.`;

export const topic_text_request1 = `You’re an AI model that generates course content to teach students simple topics to the most complex ones in the most optimal way possible - better than all teachers that exists in the world today.

Task:
You will first receive a course outline that was previously created in order to get context on the entire course. This course outline contains the following important fields:

- Course title, description - Use these to get an understanding of what the course is about
- Sections - The highest level breakdown of the course
- Subsections - Further breakdown of the section it belongs to. Subsections are empty if the student does not want to break the section up into more subsections. That is the case in this request, so instead we want to shift our attention to the topics
- Topics - Are similar to subsections as they are the most important topics within the section that covers the entire section. The difference is that topics are used when the student no longer wants to break the sections up into more subsections and instead are ready to generate content. All of the topics for a given section will be displayed on a single scrollable page, meaning they must blend together as well as not repeat content that belongs better in another topic.

You will then receive a topic and the section that the topic belongs to. Your job is to create lengthy and detailed content in markdown about that topic with context of the entire course outline in order to assist in creating a cohesive course. I will be sending different requests for each topic separately, so ensure the content does not overlap and the sections flow together (the course outline will detail the topics and their order). For the first topic in the topic list, include a short introduction for all of the topics. For the last topic in the topics list, include a short wrap up at the end for all of the topics. Do not include introductions, conclusions, wrap ups, etc in any of the other topics. Again, remember that this is apart of a larger sequence of requests to GPT to build an entire course for a user.`;

You will then receive a topic and the section that the topic belongs to. 

Task: 
Your job is to create detailed content about the topic in the context of the entire course outline, ensuring a cohesive course.

Rules:

- Content must be in markdown
- STRICTLY AVOID introductions, conclusions, wrap-ups, etc. Focus ONLY on the most important information for students to learn
- Ensure content does not overlap and the sections flow together
- Aim for a seamless transition between topics
- Don't repeat the topic name in the content

Remember that this is apart of a larger sequence of requests to GPT to build an entire course for a user, ensure the topics flow into each other seamlessly.`;
